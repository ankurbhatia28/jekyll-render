My name is Ankur.
I currently live in Oakland with my wife, Crystal, and 9 year old Maltese Poodle, Luke.
In my spare time, you will find me:
* Playing basketball
* Playing chess
* Reading
* Listening to comedy or science fiction podcasts
* Watching poorly made dating shows on Netflix



This site was very easy to create with Render, so thank you for that. Although you will find that I mis-stepped and didn't define my remote currently on GitHub at first so there is a deleted PR on the render-examples repo. Sorry about that.
